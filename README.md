# Mock Anime Streaming-Site
### For this project I wanted to replicate an anime Streaming Site with NodeJS and React. The website uses a DBMS to acces series/movie data. All images and videos will be obtained using JikanV4(MyAnimeList unofficial API) and Hyper links to https://staging.animethemes.moe (Website that hosts Anime Themes).
### Role-based access - User's and Admins have different dashboards.  
### Doing this to learning NodeJS & React along the way!  

### Application Dependencies
     npm install --global yarn
     yarn add sass
     yarn add @material-ui/icons @material-ui/core
